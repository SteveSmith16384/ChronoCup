* F1 - Toggle full Screen

## Notes for other Developers
* Development branch is the cutting edge but possibly broken branch.  Master is the most stable but out of date.
* Gradle is a real pain to work with.  However, if you have trouble loading this project, I used Gradle v4.10.3.
* The file Settings.java contains various settings that determine what game mode the game starts in.
